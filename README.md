# dotfiles_macos

I'm learning a ton about [dotfiles, command line use, Homebrew, zsh, git, macOS and more with the course ***Dotfiles from Start to Finish-ish***](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz/) by [@EIEIOxyz](https://twitter.com/EIEIOxyz/), and you can too!

## TODO
- Terminal Preferences
- Changed Shell to ZSH
- Dock Preferences
- Mission Control Preferences
- Finder Show Path Bar
- Trackpad (Three Finger Drag and Tap to Click disabled)
- Git (config and SSH)
- Alfred (Turn off spotlight and use alfred instead)
- Share this repo with a million people.
